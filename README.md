# balltriangle
a bouncing ball sim inspired by the viral youtube videos in pygame.\
want to run it for yourself? see the section below!
## how to run the sim
1. clone the repo (you need git!!!!)
```
git clone https://github.com/gameboy333/balltriangle.git
```
2. install the required modules from requirements.txt\
<sub><sup>probably not that necessary since this project only uses 2 installable modules, but i'm a good developer so why not? also do the rest of the steps in the directory you cloned this repo to!</sup></sub>
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. and run it
```
python main.py
```
or, just watch the demo [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gameboy333/balltriangle/refs/heads/main/README.md), it basically shows everything in the project
